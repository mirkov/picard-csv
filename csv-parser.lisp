;; Notes
;; -----
;;  Differences from Fare's CSV reader:
;;  * this one can import DOS formatted files into a unix image,
;;    and not have the redundant ^M splattered at the end of the fields.
;;    This is important when processing a file on a Unix server which
;;    is being uploaded via HTTP by some poor schmuck on a windoze box.
;;
;;  * Handles empty trailing fields properly
;;
;;  * comes with test suite, to see the semantics I've chosen to implement
;;
;;  * I've included a couple of high-level goodies, like
;;    do-csv-file and map-csv-file, as well as the ability
;;    to control the range of line-numbers on which to apply
;;    your code.  Pretty simple stuff, but useful.
;;
;;  * You get a CSV-file writer, for free!  :-)
